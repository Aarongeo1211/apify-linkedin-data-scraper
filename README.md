## üîí Privacy & Compliance

### Legal Considerations
- Only scrapes publicly available LinkedIn information
- Respects LinkedIn's robots.txt and rate limiting
- Uses ethical scraping practices with delays between requests
- No account credentials required (cookieless scraping)

### Data Handling
- No data is stored permanently on servers
- Contact information is handled securely
- Export files are generated client-side
- Complies with data privacy regulations

### Rate Limiting
- Batch processing with delays between requests
- Reduced concurrent requests to avoid overloading
- Automatic retry mechanisms with fallback actors

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No profiles found"
- Verify job title and location are specific enough
- Try broader search terms
- Check if the location exists on LinkedIn

#### "Search failed"
- Verify Apify API token is correct and active
- Check if actors are available and properly configured
- Review backend logs for detailed error messages

#### "Contact information missing"
- Not all profiles have publicly available contact details
- Some profiles may have privacy settings enabled
- Try different actors if one fails to extract contact info

#### Backend Connection Issues
- Ensure backend server is running on port 5001
- Check firewall settings
- Verify CORS configuration

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Batch Processing
- Profiles are processed in small batches (2 at a time)
- 3-second delays between batches for stability
- Parallel processing within batches for efficiency

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Multiple actor options for reliability
- Automatic retry with different actors
- Sample data fallback for demonstration

### Memory Management
- Efficient data transformation
- Minimal memory footprint
- Optimized for handling 10-50 profiles per search
